## About


*I am currently pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology.

*I obtained my bachelor’s degree, with the Highest Institutional Honors, in Mechanical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in December 2014. 

*I also obtained a Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering form the Georgia Institute of Technology in December 2015. A significant portion of my Master's Studies where performed in in Georgia Tech Lorraine, Georgia Tech’s Satellite Campus in France.
 
*Before Graduate School I worked for Toyota Motor Manufacturing and Nissan North America in their US headquarters. 

*These experiences partnered with my knowledge in Mechnical Engineering have tuned my analytical skills, my ability to solve complex problems and allow me to approach and solve a problem with a globally oriented mindset. 

*The goal of my research is to increase the speed and accuracy at which multiscale metal-plasticity simulations are performed.


This is a list of the projects I am currently working on:


* Grain Boundary Pinned Grain Growth: This project aims to build a Process-Structure Linkage between an initial distribution of insoluble precipitates and the resulting final Microstructure grains size distribution.
     *More info here: http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-grain-growth/


* Material Knowledge System for 2 Phase Composite*: This projects will accurately predict the deformation of a 2 phase perfectly plastic composite in a fast and computationally efficent manner.
