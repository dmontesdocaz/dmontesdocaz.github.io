## Projects

This is a list of the projects I am currently working on:

* **Grain Boundary Pinned Grain Growth**: This project aims to build a Process-Structure Linkage between an initial distribution of insoluble precipitates and the resulting final Microstructure grains size distribution. 
* **Material Knowledge System for 2 Phase Composites**: This projects will accurately predict the deformation of a 2 phase perfectly plastic composite in a fast and computationally efficent manner.
